# Cybersecurity Networking Fundamentals

Welcome to my personal cybersecurity lab notebook. This repository documents my heands-on journey through core networking and packet analysis concepts using tools like **Wireshark**, starting from the ground up. Each folder below breaks down a key networking concept with summaries, captures, and write-ups for easy studying and reference.

## Phase 1: Networking Basics

| Topic                  | Description
|------------------------|-------------------------------
| [networking_basics](./networking_basics)      | Core concepts: OSI model, IP addressing, MAC vs IP, TCP/UDP, etc.  |
| [dns_analysis](./dns_analysis)                | Packet capture and analysis of DNS queries and responses  |
| [tcp_handshake](./tcp_handshake)              | Understanding the TCP 3-way handshake (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK)  |
| [http_analysis](./http_analysis)              | Analyzing HTTP GET requests, responses, and full stream inspection  |
